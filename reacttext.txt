                                           ***** REACT ASSIGNMENT == CHAPTER:1 *****



1. Use of Emmet?
  => Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. 
      By using Emmet, email designers type less, saving both keystrokes and time when building a campaign.

2. Diffrence between Library and Framwork?
 => The framework only defines the concept but an application further defines the functionality that is useful for end-users. 
      Inversion of control: When we call a method from a library, we are in control. But in framework, the control is inverted 
     i.e. the framework calls us.

3. What is CDN?Why do we use it?
 => A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to 
     where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin 
     server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.

4. Why is React known as React?
 => React was developed for applications (Facebook) that have constantly changing data. Since React is a front-end framework or the 
     “View” in MVC, this means that as the user clicks around and changes the app's data, the view should “react” or change with those
      user events.

5. What is crossorigin in script tag?
=> The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources 
    on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images,
    fonts, or scripts) from another domain. 

6. What is diffrence between React and ReactDOM?
 => React library is responsible for creating views and ReactDOM library is responsible to actually render UI in the browser.

7. Diffrence between react.devlopment.js and react.production.js file via CDN?
 =>The development build is used - as the name suggests - for development reasons. You have Source Maps, debugging and 
    often times hot reloading ability in those builds. The production build, on the other hand, runs in production mode which 
    means this is the code running on your client's machine.

8.What is Async and Defer?
=> Async - means execute code when it is downloaded and do not block DOM construction during downloading process. 
    Defer - means execute code after it's downloaded and browser finished DOM construction and rendering process.
